# Anodynous custom keymap for Sofle Keyboard

Features:

- Symmetric modifiers (CMD/Super, Alt/Opt, Ctrl, Shift)
- Modes for Qwerty and Stenographic layout
- Separate mousekey and numpad layers
- Persistent modes for Mac vs Linux/Windows (stored in EEPROM) -> different order of modifiers and different action shortcuts on the "UPPER" layer (the red one in the image). Designed to simplify transtions when switching between operating systems often.
- The OLED on master half shows selected mode and caps lock state and is rotated.
- The OLED on slave half shows WPM counter.
- Left encoder controls volume up/down/mute, right encoder PGUP/PGDOWN on base layer. Different functionality mapped based on active layer.
